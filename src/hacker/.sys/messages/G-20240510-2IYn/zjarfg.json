Open the Java file that contains the code responsible for reading the dictionary file. In this case, it would be the `PasswordCracker.java` file.\n2. Locate the method or section of the code where the dictionary file is read. It may involve using a `File`, `Scanner`, or `BufferedReader` to open and read the file.\n3. Add a print statement to check if the file is opened successfully. For example, you can use:\n\n```java\nFile dictionaryFile = new File(\"passwords.txt\");\nif (dictionaryFile.exists()) {\n    System.out.println(\"Dictionary file exists.\");\n} else {\n    System.out.println(\"Dictionary file does not exist.\");\n}\n```\n\n4. Add a print statement to check if the contents of the file are read correctly. For example, you can use:\n\n```java\nList&lt;String&gt; passwords = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\ntry (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(dictionaryFile)) {\n    while (scanner.hasNextLine()) {\n        String password = scanner.nextLine();\n        System.out.println(\"Read password: \" + password);\n        passwords.add(password);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n5. Compile and run the program with the `passwords.txt` file in the same directory.\n6. Check the output to see if the file is opened successfully and if the contents are read correctly. If the file is not found or the contents are not read correctly, you may need to adjust the file path or the code used to read the file.\n\nAfter completing these steps, you can update the task state to \"Done\" in the system.</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"tab-content\" data-tab=\"Hide\">\n\n</div>\n</div></div></div>\n<div id=\"zaxedd\"></div>"
