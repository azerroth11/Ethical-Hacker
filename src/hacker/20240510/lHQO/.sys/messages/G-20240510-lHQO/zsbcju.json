Here's how you can do it using a stream:\n```java\nList&lt;String&gt; strings = Arrays.asList(\"hello\", \"world\", \"streams\");\nList&lt;String&gt; uppercaseStrings = strings.stream()\n                                      .map(String::toUpperCase)\n                                      .collect(Collectors.toList());\nSystem.out.println(uppercaseStrings); // prints [HELLO, WORLD, STREAMS]\n```\nIn this example, we create a stream from the `strings` list using the `stream()` method. Then, we use the `map()` method to apply the `toUpperCase()` method to each string in the stream. Finally, we collect the results into a new list using the `collect()` method and the `toList()` collector.\n\nThis is just one example of how streams can be used to process collections of data.
